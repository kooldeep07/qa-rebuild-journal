### Testing
Software Testing is the process of testing whether the software has been built as per the expected requirements and whether the software meets the customer needs or not. This is done by executing test cases and comparing the results to the expected outcomes.

### Automated testing 
It's a testing method where the test cases are executed automatically using specialized software tools. It is generally faster and more efficient than manual testing if one needs to execute multiple test cases several times, but it is also more expensive to set up and maintain.
